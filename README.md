# Float Toy with accurate decimal representation

Forked from [http://evanw.github.io/float-toy/](http://evanw.github.io/float-toy/).
This version provides accurate decimal representations, which might be useful at times,
but more often than not just too long to get any intuition to what the value actually is.
